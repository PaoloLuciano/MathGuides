# MathGuides

This is a series of Math Guides of Theorems and Interesting Results I've compiled over the years in order to keep track of my own notes. I really can´t rely on my memory so I started doing these. Also, because they were pretty helpfull on my tutoring classes and allowed me to share them with everyone else.

Clearly I haven´t had the time to update them or to work on them and they still lack a lot of content. So everyone is free to copy them and/or help me maintain them or exand them :).

Hope it's usefull for everyone.

Also, fell free to pinpoint any error you might find.

## They are in spanish.

But the Latex code is sound.
