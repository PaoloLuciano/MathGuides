# MathGuides

This is a series of Math Guides of Theorems and Interesting Results I've compiled over the years in order to keep track of my own notes and learn myself. Think of them as my own cheat sheets. I really can´t rely on my memory so I started doing these since undergrad! Also, because they were pretty helpful on my tutoring classes! 

Clearly I haven´t had the time to update them or to work on them and they still lack a lot of content. So everyone is free to copy them and/or help me maintain them or expand on them :)

Hope it's useful for somebody out.

Also, fell free to pinpoint any error you might find.

## They are in spanish.

But the Latex code is sound.
